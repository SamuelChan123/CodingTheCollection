Project’s Current Functionality:
- Login/Registration
- Project Creation 
- Upload cover image for projects
- Upload artworks (with corresponding fields)
- Upload contextual images with descriptions
- Present pages that displays all artworks in a project with contextual images/descriptions
- Present page allows user to toggle between artworks
- Editing artworks/contextual images/corresponding fields
- Editing Project names/cover photo
- Deleting Project functionality
- Deleting Artwork or contextual images functionality
- About Page for project credentials
- How It Works page with a video demonstration and instructions on how to use the platform
- Sharing of projects with other users (but other users do not have share access)

Known Bugs:
- Sometimes deleting contextual media or artworks does not delete the backend connection between artworks and contextual medias to be deleted, thus creating a front end React bug (essentially a null pointer). Hard to replicate but does happen sometimes
- Presentation page can be a little bit finicky (sometimes contextual images/descriptions do not appear)

Assumptions:
- Assume that the user is generally able to navigate a basic web-based user interface
- - Assume the user’s device is generally bigger than the size of a handheld tablet (like an iPad) so that components will not be cut off
- Assume users are generally not malicious and attempt to delete or edit projects and artworks without the consent of the authors or other curators.

Limitations:
- Full and complete usability/display may not be available for smaller displays (like small smartphones in vertical orientation)
