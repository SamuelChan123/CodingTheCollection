# Coding the Collection: Central American Art

## Purpose

Coding the Collection is a CS 408 (Delivering Software to Clients) project that our team is partnering with the Nasher Museum of Art to develop a web-application which will help 
highlight works of art which require a great deal of contextual information to fully appreciate. Users can upload images and descriptions of artworks along with relevant contextual
media and organize them in "projects". Afterwards, they can view these projects in a visually pleasing "presentation mode".
